This is a repository of potentially useful javascript programs that are related to the fields of math and science.


The files are written as either functions or programs, and this is specified in the comments at the headings of the individual scripts.


In order to run the programs, you will need to install the files package.json and package-lock.json in your respective directory, followed by the node_modules folder. These files and folder are necessary for the user to parse an input into the program that can be interpreted by javascript.
